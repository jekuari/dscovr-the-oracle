# We decided to use ML and linear regression to solve the DSCOVR Challenge.
We managed to find this Dataset:
`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingabzpro/magnet-nasa?select=dst_labels.csv` which allowed us to easily train our model using the
necessary correlations.

To use the model, you have to train it again using the corresponding dataset. But to facilitate the evaluators' job, here's a short video showcasing the project.
